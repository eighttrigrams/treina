  "Read-only-by-default gate for machine callers (agents, scripts).

  A token minted by `auth/create-machine-token` may read the whole API freely,
  but its writes are dropped unless the human has switched recording mode on.
  That way an agent can discover the surface via /api/describe and explore it
  without any risk of mutating data. Browser/human tokens are unaffected.

  Unlike tracker, treina has no events table, so dropped writes are logged
  rather than persisted as an audit trail."
